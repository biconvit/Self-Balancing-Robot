# Self-Balancing-Robot
- Designed and built a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using Arduino Uno and MPU6050 sensor for tilt measurement.
- Programmed DC motor control via L293D driver and implemented PID algorithm for stable balance.
- Fine-tuned PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd), utilized I2C communication, and processed real-time sensor data in Arduino IDE.
Technologies: C++, Arduino Uno, MPU6050 sensor, DC motors, L293D driver, PID algorithm, I2C communication.
